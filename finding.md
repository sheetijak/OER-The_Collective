# Finding and Evaluating Open Education Resources
>
There are a few things to consider when evaluating OERs:

* Provenance
* Licensing

**Provenance** is probably most intuitive: make sure OER material is coming from a reputable source. The reputation can be based upon the OER project or host, or the person who developed the materials. It can also be based upon the quality of the material themselves. [Anyone interested in a more general overview of website evaluation can consult this guide.](http://olinuris.library.cornell.edu/ref/research/webeval.html)

**Licensing** can be a bit more challenging to consider. The license controls what can be done with the work, so the first consideration should be if the material is actually allowed to be used. For instance, most proprietary textbook content cannot be publicly shared, so, depending upon the license, a faculty member could not repost content, outside of what is permitted by [Fair Use](http://www.cuny.edu/libraries/services/copyright/basics.html#fair). A Creative Commons license is usually used to indicate that a work can be used and how it can be used. [This page explains the various licenses in plain, non-legal language](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/). This post [explores the strengths and weaknesses of the various Creative Commons licenses in a more in-depth manner](http://openaccess.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2013/08/08/share-alike/). This entire OER is licensed under a Creative Commons Attirbution-ShareAlike license, meaning the entire class could be modified and used as the basis for a new class, or could be used as-is for a class, with the only limitation being that the original work would need to be credited and any new works would share the same license.

With these evaluation tools in mind, there are a wide variety of OERs to explore for content. In the spirit of OER, this module will not attempt to catalog all of them. Instead, interested faculty might begin with a list curated by Open University's Support Centre for Open Resources in Education: <http://www.open.ac.uk/score/finding>. Faculty might also consult:

* OER Commons, which represents a substantial collection of materials: <http://www.oercommons.org> as does Connexions: <http://cnx.org>

* OpenStax College, which has an impressive collection of OER textbooks for a variety of introductory classes: <http://openstaxcollege.org>

*[Lumen Learning] (http://www.lumenlearning.com/courses) links to OER frameworks, which represent entire classes. 

Google can also find Creative Commons materials. Simply do a Google search on your topic, go to advanced search, and narrow the results by usage rights. Free to share, use, or modify is probably the best place to start:
